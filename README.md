> "If adopted by everyone, we can end suffering and create happiness around the world. We are all connected."

In our mission at **The Aura Impact**, we believe true innovation happens when technology elevates humanity. While the **Golden Runway** provides an Innovation Warranty for employers and **Liquid Cash 24** provides a Sovereign Standard for individual stability, **GiveOne** is a decentralized, self-commitment framework for direct giving—dedicating **1% of earnings** and **1% of time** to empower those in need and protect nature. 

Everyone needs a helping hand at some point in their life. **GiveOne** is a powerful human chain of holding hands around the world. GiveOne is a self-commitment model that creates a global support system for everyone in need and Nature, ensuring that as we advance, we do not leave anyone or our planet behind.

## 📖 The Core Pledge
**#GiveOne**
*Let's donate 1% of what we earn and 1% of our time to help those in need & Nature. Make a difference. We are all connected.*

* **A Self-Commitment:** This is a personal dedication for giving by an individual and is not associated with any specific person or organization.
* **Non-Accumulation:** This framework is not to be used for accumulating funds.
* **The Message:** Share the message by adding the tag **#GiveOne** whenever you give to motivate others and be blessed by the Law of Nature for Giving.

GiveOne is not an organization that accumulates funds. It is a framework that operates on two simple commitments:

1.  **1% of Earnings:** A self-commitment to give 1% of what you earn to help those in need or environmental causes. Keep 1% aside from every pay you receive and use it when you encounter something that needs a helping hand.
2.  **1% of Time:** A self-commitment to dedicate 1% of your time to direct action, service, or conservation, or professional giving using your best skills to help.

## ⚡ The GiveOne Shift

| The Legacy Way (Charity) | The GiveOne Way (Framework) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ❌ Centralized Funds (High overhead/loss) | ✅ **Direct Giving** (Self-managed/100% impact) |
| ❌ Occasional Giving (Reactive) | ✅ **1% Lifecycle** (Continuous/Systemic) |
| ❌ Financial Only (Passive) | ✅ **Time & Resources** (Active/SuperHuman) |

## 🧩 The Framework Logic: Why 1%?

### 1. The Power of Numbers
If everyone in a city donates 1% to people in their own city, no one in that city will sleep without a roof or an empty stomach. Food and shelter for all is possible; small donations in large numbers make a massive difference. Most of the time when someone needs help, they just need temporary support from one helping hand.

### 2. Diversified Impact
A self-committed contribution to bring the change we want to see in the world. Donate to any cause you are interested in:
* Support relatives, friends, colleagues, or anyone you encounter who needs financial help.
* Assist the elderly, the physically challenged, or orphans.
* Provide medical assistance and sponsor education for the talented.
* Help animals, the environment, science, and research.
* **Verification:** Ensure every contribution is spent correctly; see the difference it makes firsthand.

### 3. Professional Giving: "Give One Free"
Giving can be integrated directly into your profession:
* **Doctors:** One surgery free for the poor.
* **Restaurant Owners:** One meal free for an elderly person on the street.
* **Store Owners:** One book, one tea, or one dress free from your establishment.
* **Core Principle:** Give one free from what you have.

## 🚀 High-Priority Application: Givers Fund for Employees (GFE)
To launch the GiveOne project, we are addressing a high-priority need for **January 2026**: supporting individuals impacted by massive corporate layoffs. The GFE is a high-trust, decentralized system designed to continue the current salary of impacted employees until they secure new employment.

### ✈️ First Active Reachout: The Home Depot (800 Employees)
We are working to establish the GFE system starting with the 800 impacted individuals at The Home Depot due to layoffs on **Jan 28th, 2026**. The goal is to ensure their monthly take-home pay continues without interruption through a community-backed "Givers Fund for Employees." Exact number of months of payroll extension or severance package provided by The Home Depot company to employees is not clear at this time. GFE support will start when Home Depot transition period ends and is extended to employees until successful transition to new job.

### ⚙️ The GFE Blueprint (6-Step Execution)
1.  **Institutional Setup:** Create a bank account authorized by the company (e.g., The Home Depot).
2.  **Corporate Announcement:** The company announces the account as a "Givers Fund for Employees" initiated by **The Aura Impact**. Givers worldwide transfer funds directly to this account.
3.  **Payroll Integration:** Payments are distributed through the company’s existing payroll at the usual frequency and amount. This ensures trust and removes "disclaimer" risks of personal fund accumulation.
4.  **Awareness & Transparency:** The Aura Impact team uses its channels to reach out for global awareness and hosts a live dashboard tracking funds received and the number of employees currently supported.
5.  **Transition Management:** Once 100% monthly support for the target group is reached, support continues until each individual secures a new job. The GFE bank account will be closed after all individuals have successfully transitioned to new employment.
6.  **Scaling the Success:** Once established at The Home Depot, the system will be scaled to support larger groups, such as the 16,000 employees impacted at Amazon on **Jan 28th, 2026**.

## 🚦 Smart Giving & Sustainability 
To ensure the GiveOne framework elevates humanity sustainably:

* **Innovative Solutions:** Giving models should be sustainable and continue for generations.
* **Global Motivation:** Send videos of your implemented ideas to **theauraimpact@gmail.com**. We will publish them to motivate others to replicate those models everywhere.
* **Direct Action:** Give to those in need or nature in a way that you can verify the impact yourself.
* **No Accumulation:** The Aura Impact never holds your giving funds. You are the architect of your own 1%.
* **Family Support First:** Supporting an employee means supporting a whole family. Initiatives like GFE focus on preserving family stability.
* **Nature in Balance:** Your 1% is equally dedicated to the environment to ensure "SuperHuman" progress doesn't come at the cost of the Earth.
* **Self-Preservation:** Take care of yourself while giving. Be successful in life to earn more so you can give more; stay healthy so you can donate your time and energy.
