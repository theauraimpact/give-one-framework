# Technical & Operational Requirements: GiveOne GFE Restricted Account

**Subject:** Establishment of a Restricted Fiduciary Account for the Givers Fund for Employees (GFE)  
**Framework:** GiveOne: The Universal Blueprint for Collective Power  
**Mission:** A decentralized, self-commitment framework for direct giving (1% Earnings / 1% Time)  
**Target Stakeholders:** Corporate Treasury, Banking Partners (Institutional/Commercial), and Legal Counsel  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Under the **GiveOne Framework**, the Givers Fund for Employees (GFE) provides a high-trust, decentralized system to support individuals impacted by corporate restructuring (e.g., The Home Depot, Amazon). The GFE initiative requires a specialized banking structure that allows a global community to provide a community-backed "Salary Bridge" while utilizing a corporation's existing payroll infrastructure for secure, transparent distribution.

## 2. Account Architecture: "The Fiduciary Shell"
The banking partner must establish a **Restricted Cash Account (RCA)** or an **Escrow-managed Account** with the following parameters:

* **Account Type:** Interest-bearing Fiduciary Account.
* **Legal Designation:** Held by the host Corporation "In Benefit Of" (IBO) the specifically designated employee pool.
* **Non-Accumulation Policy:** In alignment with GiveOne principles, this account is a pass-through mechanism, not a fund for long-term accumulation or corporate investment.
* **Asset Isolation:** Funds must be legally shielded from corporate creditors and excluded from the corporation’s General Ledger (GL) to avoid classification as corporate revenue or profit.

---

## 3. Inbound Funding Rails (The #GiveOne Movement)
To support the self-commitment model where givers worldwide provide direct support:

* **API-Driven Integration:** The account must support webhooks and connectivity with payment processors (e.g., Stripe, Plaid) to handle thousands of micro-contributions.
* **Source Transparency:** Ability to tag and track contributions by specific GFE campaigns (e.g., `#GFE-HomeDepot-800` or `#GFE-Amazon-16000`).
* **Compliance Automation:** Real-time Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) screening to ensure the integrity of the community-backed fund.

---

## 4. Disbursement Strategy (The Salary Bridge)
The GFE account serves as the funding source for the transition period between corporate severance/extension and new employment:

* **Restricted Outflow:** Funds are authorized for transfer *only* to the corporate **Payroll Clearing Account**.
* **Direct Integration:** Payments are distributed through the company’s existing payroll system at the usual frequency and amount, maintaining employee benefits and tax withholding integrity.
* **Sustainability:** Support continues until each individual secures new employment, at which point their allocation is redistributed or the account is closed.

---

## 5. Transparency & Live Dashboard Requirements
To maintain the "SuperHuman" progress standards of **The Aura Impact**:

* **Live Data Feed:** A secure, read-only API access point to power a public dashboard tracking funds received and the number of employees currently supported.
* **Impact Verification:** Capacity for the community to verify that 100% of contributions are reaching the intended recipients without overhead loss.
* **Daily Attestation:** Automated reporting confirming the daily balance matches the "Committed Contributions" reported by the framework.
